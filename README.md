| `Electric Vehicle (EV) Total`                 | Total BEVs + PHEVs                                         |
| `Non-Electric Vehicle Total`                  | Total of non-electric vehicles                            |
| `Total Vehicles`                              | Sum of EV and Non-EV vehicles                             |
| `Percent Electric Vehicles`                   | Share of EVs (%) among total vehicles                     |

## üßº Preprocessing Highlights

- Converted `Date` column to datetime format.
- Filled missing values in `County` and `State` with `"Unknown"`.
- Detected and capped outliers in `Percent Electric Vehicles` using IQR method.
- Converted object-type numeric columns (BEVs, PHEVs, etc.) to integers.
- Engineered time-series features: lag variables, rolling means, percent changes, and EV growth slopes.
- Created preprocessed dataset: `preprocessed_ev_data.csv`.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Analyze EV adoption trends at the county level in Washington State.
- Forecast future EV adoption for the next 36 months (2024-2027).
- Identify high-growth counties to assist infrastructure planning (charging stations, grid upgrades).
- Provide data-driven insights for policy-making and urban mobility strategies.
